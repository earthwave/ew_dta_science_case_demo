# ew_dta_science_case_demo

A public repository containing material to demo an open science case on the ESRIN HPC.

The main purpose of this repository is to be cloned into a Jupyterlab instance (created using [ew_dta_open_science](https://github.com/earthwave/ew_dta_open_science)), allowing access to an open science notebook and tools for loading data. 
It should be no means consider an example for how an open science case should be delivered.
